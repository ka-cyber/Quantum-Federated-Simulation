Quantum-Enhanced Federated Edge Intelligence Simulation

🌍 Vision

This project is a prototype of my larger dream: building a complete simulation platform for autonomous, intelligent, and secure cyber-physical systems. Instead of spending millions on specialized hardware, this environment uses software-based simulation to explore cutting-edge concepts at a fraction of the cost.

The long-term vision is to create a digital twin laboratory where quantum communication, federated learning, network reliability, and cyber-physical safety can all be studied and improved in a unified, interactive way.

🚀 What This Prototype Demonstrates

1. Quantum Communication Layer

• Simulates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols like BB84.

• Models noise, error rates, and quantum fidelity in real-time.

• Shows how quantum security can be integrated into edge intelligence systems.

2. Federated Learning Framework

• Multi-client distributed learning with realistic participation.

• Byzantine attack simulations (sign-flip, Gaussian noise, zero updates).

• Trust score tracking and anomaly detection.

3. Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

• Drone swarm simulation with safety guarantees.

• Lyapunov-based safety checks, fallback controls, and real-time visualization.

• Physics-based models for sensor noise, dynamics, and disturbances.

4. Network Simulation Layer

• Emulates network conditions (latency, throughput, jitter, packet loss).

• Models mesh topologies with ~50 nodes.

• Supports RLNC (Random Linear Network Coding) efficiency testing.

5. Security Dashboard

• Tracks threat levels in real-time.

• Logs anomalies, false positives, and adversarial defense responses.

6. Interactive visualization of threat intensities.

• Integrated Platform

• Orchestrates everything together in a web dashboard with interactive charts and controls.

• Built to allow plug-and-play experimentation without physical labs.

🎯 Why It Matters

• Research Acceleration: Cuts costs by over 90% compared to hardware setups.

• Accessibility: Opens the door for students, researchers, and innovators without access to million-dollar testbeds.

• Interdisciplinary Fusion: Combines quantum communication, machine learning, control theory, and networking in one environment.

• Scalability: Designed to expand from a small simulation to full-scale system tests.
