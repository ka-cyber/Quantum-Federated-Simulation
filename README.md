Quantum-Enhanced Federated Edge Intelligence Simulation

Quantum Federated Simulation is a research prototype that explores how multiple security-critical domains can be unified into a single experimental platform. The project combines elements of quantum communication, federated learning, cyber-physical system safety, and adaptive network control, with the goal of creating an integrated environment where complex interactions can be studied under controlled scenarios.

At the core of the platform is a simulation engine that can be configured through YAML scenarios and data traces. These inputs define network topologies, drone trajectories, quantum channel characteristics, attack patterns, and federated learning client behaviors. By varying parameters such as noise in a quantum key distribution channel, the presence of Byzantine clients in federated aggregation, or failures in control loops for mobile CPS agents, the simulation generates outputs that reflect how a distributed system behaves when exposed to layered threats.

The web interface provides a live dashboard that visualizes these dynamics as the simulation progresses. Quantum fidelity, federated accuracy, safety indicators for CPS processes, and network reliability metrics evolve in real time, offering a high-level overview of system health. Alongside these metrics, the dashboard maintains a timeline of events, client activity summaries, and performance statistics, making it easier to spot how localized disturbances ripple through the system.

The project is not intended as a finished product but as a flexible environment for experimentation. It allows researchers and practitioners to test hypotheses, reproduce results across different runs, and compare the impact of adversarial conditions on diverse subsystems. The current version demonstrates synthetic scenarios but is designed to be extended with more advanced models, external simulators, or real datasets. Future directions include tighter integration with quantum simulation libraries, reinforcement-learning-based control for adaptive responses, and more comprehensive security dashboards that unify alerts across domains.

The overarching vision is to provide a space where quantum communication, distributed learning, and safety-critical systems can be examined together rather than in isolation. By offering a single point of experimentation, Quantum Federated Simulation aims to support research in trustworthy distributed intelligence at the intersection of security, resilience, and emerging computation.
